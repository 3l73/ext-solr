The shell scripts to install Apache Solr with Tomcat will likely change soon.
Please also be aware that the Solr Version 4.8.x is no longer on the Apache Mirrors and can only be found here: http://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/solr/4.8.1/

Additionaly JAVA 7 is no longer supported with security updates by Oracle since April 2015.
See: https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_7.xml

We will introduce Apache Solr 5.x Support with a next version of the EXT:solr Extension.
